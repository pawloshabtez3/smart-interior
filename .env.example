# Smart Interior Design Previewer - Environment Variables
# 
# This MVP does not require any environment variables.
# All configuration is handled through:
# - next.config.js for build configuration
# - Browser localStorage for user preferences
# - Static assets served from /public directory
#
# For future enhancements, you might add:
# - NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.example.com (for backend integration)
# - NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID=your-analytics-id (for analytics)
# - NEXT_PUBLIC_CDN_URL=https://cdn.example.com (for CDN assets)
#
# Note: Variables prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_ are exposed to the browser.
# Never store sensitive keys in NEXT_PUBLIC_ variables.
