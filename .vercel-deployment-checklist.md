## Deployment Steps

1. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Ready for Vercel deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel**
   - Option A: Use Vercel CLI (`vercel --prod`)
   - Option B: Connect GitHub repo in Vercel dashboard

3. **Post-Deployment Verification**
   - [ ] Visit production URL
   - [ ] Test all routes
   - [ ] Verify 3D models load
   - [ ] Test on mobile device
   - [ ] Check browser console for errors
   - [ ] Test localStorage persistence
   - [ ] Test snapshot export

## Production URL
Once deployed, your app will be available at:
- `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`

## Rollback Plan
If issues occur:
1. Go to Vercel dashboard → Deployments
2. Select previous working deployment
3. Click "Promote to Production"

## Notes
- First deployment may take 2-3 minutes
- Subsequent deployments are faster (1-2 minutes)
- Vercel provides automatic HTTPS
- CDN caching is automatic for static assets
